This directory contains definitions of OSKit components for use with
the Knit component definition and linking language.  You can get a

The following list summarises what is covered by the current component
set.  The most obvious omission is complete support for multithreading.


  Standard library code:
  - memory allocators
  - math and string support
  - getenv, exit, atexit, panic
  - printing/parsing code (printf, fprintf, sprintf, ..., gets, sscanf, ...)
  - qsort
  - longjmp
  
  Device driver support code:
  - memory allocators
  - resource reservation
  - device and driver registries
  - interrupt and timer handlers
  - debugging/logging hooks
  
  Console code:
  - serial line and VGA

  Debugging:
  - killswitch
  - debugging over serial line
  - stack traces

  Network code:
  - ethernet device drivers
  - tcp/ip stack
  - simple udp implementation (fudp)
  - simple arp implementation (farp)
  - posix network wrappers
  - standard C library network support

  Filesystem code:
  - IDE disk driver
  - scsi disk drivers (untested)
  - memory filesystem
  - freebsd filesystem
  - linux filesystems (untested)
  - posix filesystem wrappers
  - standard C library file support

  Threads and locks:
  - disable preemption and interrupts (base_critical)
  - thread and lock package
  - threadsafe wrappers for network, filesystem, etc
  - threadsafe versions of numerous standard library functions

  Time:
  - posix time functions
  - stdlib time functions

  Virtual memory:
  - page protection component (SVM) - not tested thoroughly (at all?)
  - posix wrapper for VM system

  Bootstrapping:
  - multiboot specific code
  - x86 specific code
  - many initializers

  COM:
  - queues
  - listener and listener fanouts

  Some work started on PXE boot, netboot, netdisk, etc. but not
  completed (i.e., it didn't work).
