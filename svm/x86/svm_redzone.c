 * Handle the details of stack redzones. For the x86 we must use a task
 * gate to handle stack overflow since faults dump state onto the current
 * stack when there is no priv level change (as is the case in the base
 * oskit). That of course will lead to a double fault, and then a machine
 * reset without any idea of what happened. By installing a task gate for
 * for T_DOUBLE, the double fault will cause a switch into a different task
 * with a new stack. At that point we can figure out what thread caused the
 * stack overflow, and then shutdown gracefully. It would be nice if we
 * could recover and just kill that thread, but a double fault is deemed
 * non-recoverable, and appears to leave the machine in an odd state.
