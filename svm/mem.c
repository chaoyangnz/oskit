 * Implementation of osenv memory interface. Together with osenv_mem.c
 * in this directory, override the default memory interface defined in
 * the dev directory. This implementation is basically the same, since
 * we are not doing anything fancy. Clients of the memory interface are
 * going to get back physical memory, which is already mapped into the
 * virtual address range (by virtue of how SVM works). The difference is
 * in how I/O memory is handled. mem_map_phys maps I/O space locations
 * into the virtual range so that device drivers can access them.
