Description:
	The SVM library provides a *simple* virtual memory extension that
	allows applications to allocate virtual memory and assign
	protections to memory regions. A simple pager is also provided.
	The interface is much like mmap/mprotect. The pthreads module
	uses svm to implement stack guards.

	The x86 and arm32 directory contains machine specific trap
	code and code to interface to the kernel pdir routines.
