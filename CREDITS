OSKit Contributors

While much of the code in the OSKit was developed outside the
University of Utah, by large free operating systems projects-- most
notable are the FreeBSD, Linux, Mach and NetBSD projects-- the OSKit
proper was developed by members of the University of Utah's Flux
Research Group, including (in alphabetical order):
	Chris Alfeld
	Dave Andersen
	Godmar Back
	Greg Benson (U.C. Davis on location at Utah)
	Steve Clawson
	Bryan Ford
	Shantanu Goel
	Mike Hibler
	Jay Lepreau
	Roland McGrath
	Bart Robinson
	Steve Smalley (on location at Utah)
	Leigh Stoller
	Sai Susarla
	Patrick Tullmann
	Kevin Van Maren
While many of these made huge contributions, Bryan Ford stands out for
conceiving the OSKit and doing most of the early development and
architecture.  The majority of the OSKit work was done under DARPA
support, which we gratefully acknowledge.  The GNU build tool chain
was essential, as usual.  Finally, we thank our brave early users,
especially the MIT Express Project.
