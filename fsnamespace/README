Description:
	The filesystem namespace component provides ``namei'' style
	translation (typically for C/POSIX library), as well as high
	level mount and unmount capibilities. Multi component names
	(those with "slashes") are translated into oskit_file and
	oskit_dir COM objects. Namei style caching is also supported
	to reduce the overhead of calling into the device driver
	framework. 

        Both single and multithreaded versions of the fsnamespace
        component are provided. Both of these libraries can be found
        in the lib directory as oskit_fsnamespace.a and
        oskit_fsnamespace_r.a.
