Description: 
	This library implements the OSKit Device Driver	and
	"OS environment" Framework, a framework designed to allow the
	use in the OSKit of pre-existing device drivers and other
	subsystems from other operating systems.

	This is a default implementation of the dev and osenv support
	code, and relies heavily on libkern and lmm, with a very
	minimalistic environment.  (For example, it doesn't support
	paging).

	The device and osenv routines are mixed together here due to
	historical reasons and will eventually be split up.  You will
	see a lot of "fdev" references also, which is this code's
	historical name.
