Description: 
	A runtime linker/loader for ELF compiled oskit kernels. This
	library is based on the FreeBSD 3.0 rtld-elf library, and
	allows an OSKit kernel to load shared libraries (.so files).
	The typical set of rtld functions is exported: dlopen, dlsym,
	dlclose, dlerror.

	See the demonstration kernel in examples/dyntest.

	NOTE: We need to use a linker script because a bug in the 2.9
	linker causes -Ttext argument to be ignored when used in
	combination with the -shared option. So, the text offset must
	be plugged into a linker script. See the examples/dyntest
	GNUmakerules file.
