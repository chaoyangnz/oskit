The OSKit document is a work in progress; ~575 pages and still growing.

The document in its current form suffers from a variety of maladies:

1. The document is incomplete.
   There still remain many interfaces which are not covered.

2. The document is occasionally incorrect.
   That is, there are periodic discontinuities between the documentation
   and the implementation.

3. The document is really two different documents crammed into one.
   Much of the expository text (rationale, extended descriptions) belongs
   in an overview or introductory document.  The more concise ``man pages''
   belong in an API reference manual.

4. The API pages are not ordered in a consistent manner.
   Some API sections are arranged alphabetically, some are presented in
   a manner logical to how you would use them in a program, while others are
   seemingly ordered arbitrarily.

5. The document as a whole is ``stylistically diverse.''
   Some sections are complete and well organized as standalone documents;
   others are highly context dependent.  Some present far more information
   than is necessary while others are woefully inadequate.  The formatting
   of various pieces is equally diverse.

6. We need a short tutorial document that is a guide for the new user, based
   around some of the examples.
  
As such, we are very interested in feedback about the document, both formatting
and content issues.  Anything that is missing, wrong, ugly, or could be
presented better we want to hear about.
