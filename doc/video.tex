\section{Introduction}

Video support is currently a three-way mishmash and it's incomplete, but it
provides useful services for some popular boards.

The first way provides the XFree86 S3 driver and its normal XFree86
interface, along with a few other functions.

The second way provides the VGA portion of the well known ``Svgalib''
library for Linux.

The third way for \oskit{} kernels to access video (and the keyboard and
mouse) is via X11 client support.  Through this support \oskit{} kernels
can interact (like any other X client) with remote machines running an
X server.  In the {\tt x11/client} source directory we provide patches against
both the stock XFree86 X11R6.3 and XConsortium X11R6.3 distributions,
along with helper functions specific to the \oskit.  See the README's there.
