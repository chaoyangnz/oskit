\section{Svgalib Video Library}
\label{svgalib}

The video_svgalib library contains the VGA portion of the well known ``svgalib''
library.  It does not support the keyboard, joystick, mouse or gl
functionality of svgalib.

This library and its interface may change or disappear in the future,
but it's useful for now.

\subsection{So how do I use this?}

The interface is the same as the VGA interface for Svgalib.  The extensive man
pages for those functions are in {\tt oskit/video/svgalib/doc}, handily
formatted for you.  Svgalib
programs that use only the VGA interface should work with little
change: you should only have to add code to do \oskit{} initialization.

For an example of how to convert an svgalib program, you can look at
{\tt examples/x86/svgalib.c}, which is one of the standard svgalib example
programs converted to run on the oskit.

\subsection{Dependencies}

video_svgalib depends on {\tt oskit_startup, oskit_dev, oskit_kern,
oskit_freebsd_m, oskit_c}, and {\tt oskit_lmm}.
