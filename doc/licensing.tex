\section{Copyrights \& Licenses}

The \oskit{} is free software, also known as ``open source'' software.
The majority of the \oskit\ is covered by the standard GNU Public
License (GPL), found in the file ``COPYING,'' which basically allows
free use, modification, and redistribution, as long as the source to the
\oskit{} and any code linked against it is made freely available.
If this appears too constraining,
alternate licensing terms for much of the \oskit\ may be explored by
contacting csl-dist@cs.utah.edu or calling +1-801-585-3271.
Reproduction of the documentation is limited to non-commercial
uses, including academic, research, evaluation, and personal use.
For alternate terms, contacts are the same as above.

Because much of the code in the \oskit\ was ``donated'' by external
projects there are a plethora of additional copyrights and licences,
but their requirements are straightforward.
Some parts of the OSKit are additionally covered by BSD/Mach/X11-style
licenses which require acknowledgement and sometimes a notice in any
advertising.

The individual
files describe the copyright and licensing restrictions.  In all cases
the BSD/Mach/X11-style restrictions are no more than inclusion of a name
or notice in the
accompanying documentation of the program that uses the code.  For
example, when linking in code from the FreeBSD project that is
copyrighted by the Regents of the University of California,
accompanying documentation must include the copyright and license
notice, while advertising materials using the library must include the
acknowledgement ``This product includes software developed by the
University of California, Berkeley and its contributors.''  Other
BSD-style license have similar requirements, but for a different
copyright holder.

To help clarify matters, the Acknowledgements section, below,
describes which parts of the \oskit\ are covered by which license(s).

\section{Contributors} %or Credits

While much of the code in the \oskit\ was developed outside the
University of Utah, by large free operating systems projects---%
most notable are the FreeBSD, Linux, Mach and NetBSD projects---%
the \oskit{} proper was developed by members of the University
of Utah's Flux Research Group, including (in alphabetical order):
	Chris Alfeld,	% wimpi
	Dave Andersen,	% gprof
	Godmar Back, % bsd networking, device driver framework, ...
	Greg Benson (U.C.\ Davis on location at Utah), % old threads, discussion, testing
	Steve Clawson, % video, x11, device driver framework, wimpi
	Bryan Ford,  % libkern, libc, liblmm, dev framework, freebsd drivers, ...
	Shantanu Goel, % original linux dev framework, some oskit'ification
	Mike Hibler, % libamm, device driver framework, docs
	Jay Lepreau,	% mgmt, funding, docs, testing
	Roland McGrath,	% testing, COMification,
	Bart Robinson, % linux vfs, netboot, hpfq, device driver framework
	Steve Smalley (on location at Utah), % netbsd fs
	Leigh Stoller,	% threading, cpu inheritance, svm, freebsd_c, ...
	Sai Susarla, % cpu inheritance prototype
	Patrick Tullmann, % libmemdebug, this list of contributors :),
	and
	Kevin Van Maren. % libsmp, libdiskpart, dev framework, driver upgrades, ...
While many of these made huge contributions, Bryan Ford stands out for
conceiving the \oskit{} and doing most of the early development and
architecture.  The majority of the \oskit{} work was done under DARPA
support, which we gratefully acknowledge.  Finally, the GNU build tool
chain was essential, as usual.

\section{Acknowledgements}

Libraries that contain source code licensed under some variation of
the BSD-style license generally contain the restriction that the
copyright holders of that code be acknowledged in documentation
accompanying the program.  Because not all users of the \oskit\ need to
acknowledge all of the multitudinous authors of the available code in
the \oskit, we have broken down the acknowledgement requirements on a
per-library basis.  The remainder of this chapter lists each library
and the license requirements of linking in that library.  Note that
some licenses only show up in files that you may not need or use in
that library.

We have done our best to make this accurate and to include notices as
required, but have probably missed things.  If so, let us know.  The
source code is the final authority.
