Description:  
	1. Header files that describe COM interfaces for
	simple BSD-Sockets. (socket.h)

	2. freebsd.h: This header file contains the function
	declarations needed to bring up and use the FreeBSD
	derived network code.

	The second part contains an OLD interface on top of which
	the COM adaptors are implemented. (Functions such as
	bsdnet_listen) Note that these are DEPRECATED - the
	COM adaptors will soon be the only way to access
	the functionality of the TCP/IP library.
