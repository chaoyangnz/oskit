   XXX THESE INLINE FUNCTIONS ARE DANGEROUS!! XXX
   Not because of what they do, but because of their structure.
   They contain ASM labels, so if they are inlined more than once
   in a function, you wind up with a multiply defined symbols.
   This can happen, for example, if GCC is doing aggressive inlining (-O3).
   I avoided this problem once already in x86/pc/i16_raw.c by rearranging
   the functions and counting on a particular heuristic of GCC (that it
   will not inline calls that precede a function's definition).
