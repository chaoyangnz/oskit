/*
 * This file simply lists the current set of Linux Ethernet drivers.
 * This list is used for building liboskit_linux_dev itself,
 * by <oskit/dev/linux.h> to declare all the function prototypes,
 * and can be used by clients of the OSKIT as well
 * as an automated way to stay up-to-date with the supported drivers.
 *
 * Each driver is listed on a separate line in a standard format,
 * which can be parsed by the C preprocessor or other text tools like awk:
 *
 * driver(name, description, vendor, author, filename, probe)
 *
 * name is the abbreviated name of the device, e.g., 'aha1542'.
 * description is the longer device name, e.g., 'Adaptec 1542'.
 * vendor is the name of the hardware vendor supplying this device.
 * author is the name of the author(s) of the device driver.
 * filename is the base filename of the Linux device driver.
 * probe is the name of the Linux probe function for this driver.
 *
 * These drivers are listed in the same order
 * in which they appear in Linux's drivers/net/Space.c file;
 * this is important as it typically determines probe order.
 * 
 * XXX: the above isn't strictly true, since linux keeps changing the 
 * probe order in new kernels.
 * XXX: Probe order verified and adjusted against Linux 2.2.22
 * XXX: Several new drivers collide with FreeBSD equivalents,
 *      these Linux drivers are commented out to avoid collision.
