Description:  
	Include files for all of the OSKit are here.
	(except for netbsd, linux, or freebsd specific
	ones that are parts of those distributions.)

	OSKit-original headers are in this directory;
	the c/ subdirectory has most of the standard
	POSIX includes.

	The x86/ subdirectory contains machine specific
	details for header files in this directory AND
	all the other subdirectories.  (e.g., 
	oskit/c/float.h includes machine specific info 
	from oskit/x86/c/float.h)
	
	The other directories generally correspond to 
	the similarly named library.
