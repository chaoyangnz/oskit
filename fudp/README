Description: 
	A Fake UDP implementation.  It provides a simple send-only UDP
	interface without fragmentation.  Basically, only oskit_socket_sendto
	is provided.  

	This is useful for the H-PFQ link-sharing code and is used by
	examples/x86/hpfq_fudp.c.

	Notable holes in this implementation are:

		- It cannot send thru a gateway.  It expects the destination
		  to be on the local network.  This is not hard to fix:
		  just decide on an interface to obtain the netmask and gateway
		  address and fix 'sk_sendto' to send to the gateway if
		  needed.

		- It does not invoke the ARP protocol to map IP addresses to
		  ethernet addresses.  Instead it expects the caller of this
		  library to load our fake ARP table via 'farp_add'.
