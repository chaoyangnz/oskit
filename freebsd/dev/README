Description:  
	This directory contains glue code for using
	the FreeBSD device driver set under the OSKit
	Device Framework.

	x86/ contains machine specific files, and
	x86/conf/ contains configuation header
	files that are normally generated by the
	FreeBSD configuration utility.

	include/ contains bogus header files simply used
	to fake out the FreeBSD code when compiling.
