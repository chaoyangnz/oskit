Description:  
	This directory contains an implementation of CPU Inheritance
	Scheduling; the idea was presented in the Utah OSDI'96 paper
	[FordSusarla].  To compile the threads directory with CPUI
	instead of the standard POSIX scheduler, define CPU_INHERIT in
	the threads GNUmakerules file.

	This version of the code is somewhat buggy. At times
	scheduling operations will be missed and the program will hang
	because a thread wakeup did not happen. The next version will
	be much better.

	There are four schedulers.  First is a standard POSIX
	scheduler, which is used as the root scheduler, but can also
	be instantiated as a FIFO/RR scheduler anywhere else in a
	hierarchy. Also included are very simple implementations of
	RateMono, Lotto, and Stride schedulers.
