srealloc, scalloc (native and debug versions)

Add statistics gathering.  
	which functions
	what sizes
	fragmentation
	timestamps

Add the ability to check each block for a live flob when its free'd.

The lock used to protect the global list of allocated memory is the
same as the lock used to protect the memory allocator (we use
mem_lock() and mem_unlock()) perhaps these should be different locks.

Make the compile-time options of the library (detect free(0), etc)
into run-time options.  Provide an interface for manipulating them.

The sweep, mark, and check functions all have names that are too
confusingly similar (can you tell which is the matching pair of the
three?)
