# SUBDIRS must be set to the complete list of subdirectories
# which contain Makefiles to descend into.
# The directories can be listed in any order.

# FIRST_SUBDIRS can be a subset of those subdirectories
# which must be built before all other subdirectories,
# in the order specified in FIRST_SUBDIRS.

# Similarly, LAST_SUBDIRS can be a subset of the SUBDIRS
# which must be built after all others,
# in the specified order.
#
# Naturally, FIRST_SUBDIRS and LAST_SUBDIRS should not overlap.
