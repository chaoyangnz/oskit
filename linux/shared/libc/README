Description:  

	Linux device driver and filesystem support glue code

	This directory contains self-contained implementations of
	any ``libc'' type routines required by the drivers or the
	glue code.

	They are not allowed to reference the OSKit headers, or
	depend on them for linking.  Functions that an OS might
	want to override are channeled through the osenv_* 
	interfaces. (Note that the `oskit/dev' headers can be 
	included, to access required prototypes, etc.)

	Most of these files are stripped-down versions of OSKit 
	liboskit_c library files or are written from scratch.
