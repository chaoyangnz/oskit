# This rule generates a file called `filesystems' which we include to
# define the FILESYSTEMS variable and some rules.
# The FILESYSTEMS var will contain a list of the names of the filesystems
# included according to the <oskit/fs/linux_filesystems.h> file.
# The rules we define are to allow us to build all the filesytem files
# in one directory.
# The problem is that Linux keeps the per-filesytem code in their
# own directories and file names aren't scoped.
# Additionally, the source files do stuff like #include "../fat/tables.h".
# Here, we make rules that scopify the names by making symbolic links
# to the source files,
# and that compile the source files with an additional -I path.
# We link the files to CWD instead of doing `cc -o foo_inode.o foo/inode.c'
# because the -MD gcc flag would make inode.d instead of foo_inode.d.
