  e.g., to allow creation of standalone user-mode driver executables.

* Get rid of 'fdev_default_xxx' dependencies

* Don't use block/genhd.c at all; just get rid of it completely.

* Get rid of the 'linux_event_block()' bogosity.

* Get rid of OSENV_PHYS_WIRED

* What's the immediate_bh() business?

* Figure out what to do with include/linux/autoconf.h

* What's the deal with the net_debug stuff?

* What's the unplug_device routine for,
  and what's the XXX in blk_dev_init() about it?
