Description:  
	This directory contains glue code for using
	the Linux v2.2.22 device driver set under the 
	OSKit Device Framework.


CAVEAT:
This file was correct as of 11/98 when the Linux 2.0.29 drivers were
part of the OSKit.  When the drivers were upgraded to Linux 2.2.12
in 11/99, this file was not updated. Neither was it updated when the
tree was updated to Linux 2.2.22.


Device Drivers Tested:
======================
Please send us working/broken feedback for untested drivers,
and any results that don't agree with these.

Things haven't tested:
======================
non 512-byte sectors (SCSI) (try Optical Disk)
WD80x3			wd		(OLD 8-bit card)
80386 machine
Intel Pro/10+		eepro100	PCI


These failed testing:
=====================
DEC EtherWorks III	ewrk3		ISA	EISA config (bad packets)
Ultrastor 34F		u14-34f		VL-Bus	(not found)
Ultrastor 34F		ultrastor	VL-Bus	(not found)
	Note: after tweaking the probe, it (?) found the card and CDROM,
	but not the scsi disk.



Drivers Not Yet Supported:
=========================
SCSI Tape		st
SCSI CD-ROM		sr
IDE Tape		ide-tape
Floppy			fd
All ISDN
All Character Devices
All Sound Devices
non-x86 drivers
Proprietary CD-ROM drivers
Digi Intl. RightSwitch SE-X (dgrs)
Myrinet driver (from Myricom)
PCMCIA drivers


No Linux (2.0.29) Driver:
=========================
BusLogic Flashpoint		PCI	(in 2.0.30)
(probably anything else)
[several of the newer ethernet cards are not supported in 2.0.29,
but should "just work" by adding Becker's driver]
