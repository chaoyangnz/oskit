	Zlib 1.1.3 (http://www.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/zlib/)
Description:
	This directory contains the infrastructure necessary to
	build a version of the zlib compression library as an OSKit
	library.  This has been tested only with zlib version 1.1.3.

	To build the library, download zlib via:
	ftp://www.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/zlib/zlib-1.1.3.tar.gz
	untar it and rename the resulting zlib-1.1.3 to be "src".

	Add zlib to the appropriate "modules" file (modules.x86.pc
	or modules.arm32.shark) in the main OSKit directory.
	Configure and build the OSKit as normal!
