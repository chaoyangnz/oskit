Directories: oskit/clientos
Target: Default implementation of the Client OS. This library is mandatatory
        for all oskit kernels, although its exact implementation can vary.
Documentation: See the source files
Original Code Source: Flux Research Group, University of Utah
Description:  
	The Oskit libraries, in particular the C libraries, rely on
	the existence of a Client OS library to provide default
	implementations of many things, such as where to get memory,
	the console object, how to exit, etc. Rather than depend on
	linktime hell, the Client OS defines all this stuff in a few
	well understood COM objects. These objects are installed in
	the device registry, where other libraries can pick them up as
	needed.

	This library is mandatory for all oskit kernels.
