Description: 
	A simple UDP implementation.  It provides a simple send and recv
	UDP interface without fragmentation. There are no options supported.
        Unlike FUDP, this library does real arp and operates on the supplied
	ethernet device directly, instead of a supplied netio.

	This library is used by netdisk, and perhaps netboot at some point.

	Notable holes in this implementation are:

		- Its very simple.

		- Only handles one interface.

		- Concept of gateway is pretty simplistic.

		- No fragmentation or reassembly.

		- ICMP support is for ping only!
