Target: dyntest dummy.so dopey.so
Original Code Source:

Description: 
	This directory contains a demonstration of how to use the
	runtime linker/loader (RTLD) library. The example kernel
	(dyntest) will load dummy.so, find a symbol in it, and then
	call that function. The loaded file (dummy.so) contains a
	trivial function that calls printf.

	See the extensive comments in the GNUmakerules file on how to
	link the kernel, and build shared libraries for it. See the
	comments in dyntest.c and dummy.c that explain what is
	happening.
