Description:  
	Each .c file in this directory is an example kernel.
	All the kernels demonstrate or test some functionality 
	of the OSKit.  

	Many of them hardcode various options, such as the
	ether device to open, or the drive partition to use,
	in #defines at the top of the file.

	Note that many of these are not really x86-specific,
	but are here for historical reasons.  They will eventually
	migrate.
