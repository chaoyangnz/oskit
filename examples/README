Description:
	Toy example kernels for all the supported platforms.

Here is a brief breakdown of the examples:

Trivial programs good for demonstrating how to build and boot a kernel:

	hello.c
	multiboot.c

Very simple programs that demonstrate how to use basic components:

	timer.c
	mouse.c
	more/gethostbyname.c
	bmodfs.c
	timer_com.c
	video.c

Simple programs that demonstrate the use of more complex components:

	tty.c
	more/mmap_dev_mem.c
	diskpart.c
	blkio.c
	fsread.c
	more/diskpart2.c

Slightly more complex programs that use the network components:

	socket_bsd.c
	socket_com.c
	pingreply.c
	fudp.c
	hpfq_udp.c
	more/select.c

Slightly more complex programs that use the filesystem components:

	linux_fs_com.c
	netbsd_fs_com.c
	more/netbsd_fs_posix.c
	more/fsbmodmount.c

Slightly more complex programs that use various components:

	anno_test.c
	smp.c
	more/timer_com2.c
	more/socket_com2.c
	more/dd.c
	vgatest.c

POSIX threads programs, listed in order of increasing complexity:

	dphils.c
	quicksort.c
	disktest.c
	disknet.c
	http_proxy.c

Misc programs

	more/memtest.c
	more/bufio_stream_recv.c
	more/bufio_stream_send.c
	more/uspf.c
	more/spf.c
	more/stream_netio.c
