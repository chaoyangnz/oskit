	fill in the gaps when linking with X client code.

	client/ contains simple functions to add some missing 
	functionality that the X client code relies on

	video/ contains glue code for x11video

	src/ contains lightly modified sources from the 
	XFree86 3.3.1 source, consisting of the s3 video driver 
	code.  The few oskit changes are demarked with #ifdef OSKIT.
