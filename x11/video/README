Description:  
	s3 video driver taken from XFree86 3.3.1

	To use this driver, you'll have to include an XF86Config file
	for it.  There is a sample one in this directory.  You'll
	need to make sure that it's installed as /etc/XF86Config.
	
	This file is actually a subset of a standard XF86Config file.
	It can only contain a Monitor, Device and Screen section.  The
	easist way to make one is to take your standard XF86Config
	file and remove everything except for those three sections.
