Description:  
	Simple functions to add some missing functionality that the X
	client code relies on.  Most of these are either very naive 
	implementations, or are dependent on the workings of other 
	parts of the oskit (libc mostly).  Feel free to replace them
	with real functions.  There is also no guarantee that this
	collection is complete, you may need to add more functions
	when you run into them.
