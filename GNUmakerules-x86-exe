# This is a generic set of rules to build DOS executables (.exe files).

# Assumes the build tools support the i386msdos format and emulation.
# Currently also assumes we're using ELF for object files and such.

# First link the program as an ELF executable,
# but with the proper MS-DOS memory layout;
# then use objcopy to transform the result into an MSDOS executable.
# This approach has three advantages:
#	* It avoids some bugs in the MSDOS BFD backend.
#	* It allows some ELF features unsupported
#	  by the MSDOS backend to be used.
#	* It provides with a convenient nm-able and objdump-able
#	  version of the executable, for debugging purposes.
