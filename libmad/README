	MAD 0.12.3b libmad (http://www.mars.org/home/rob/proj/mpeg/)
Description:
	This directory contains the infrastructure necessary to build
	a version of the libmad MPEG audio decoder library as an OSKit
	library.  This has been tested only with the MAD 0.12.3b version
	of libmad.

	To build the library, download zlib via:
	ftp://ftp.mars.org/pub/mpeg/archive/mad-0.12.3b.tar.gz
	untar it and rename the resulting "mad-0.12.3b" to be "src".

	Add libmad to the appropriate "modules" file (modules.x86.pc
	or modules.arm32.shark) in the main OSKit directory.
	Configure and build the OSKit as normal!
