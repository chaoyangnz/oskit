Description: 
	NetDisk is a kernel that allows you to write data to raw
	partitions on any disk. You can write either the entire disk,
	a slice, or a BSD partition inside of a slice.

	This ability is useful for loading disks or partitions with
	complete disk images (such as filesystems, boot blocks, etc).

	The image must be in the format expected by netdisk, as
	described in imagehdr.h in this directory. This is a simple
	format, with a single 1K block prepended to hold the size of
	the image and a magic number.

	Netdisk optionally (default is on) uses the zlib compression
	library. In this case, the image data may be compressed, as
	indicated by the magic number in the header described above.

	Netdisk can be compiled to use either the UDP library or the
	complete freebsd network stack. This is controlled by the
	FREEBSD_NET define. The default is the UDP library since the
	freebsd library makes for a much bigger binary.

	You can use netdisk in either command line or interactive
	mode. If provided with a command line, netdisk will load the
	requested partitions and then exit. In interactive mode, you
	issues load requests and then type "exit" or "quit" to exit
	the command loop. The format of a command in either case is:

	       <IPaddr|host>:<path> <partition>[:partition]
	       
	   For example:

	       155.22.33.44:/home/foo/diskimage wd1
	   or
	       myhost:/home/foo/diskimage wd1:b

	Multiple commands can be issued in both interactive and
	command line mode. The directory containing the image file
	must be an NFS exported directory.

	In the above example, "myhost" will be passed to the DNS
	library for hostname lookup. The default domain is the one
	supplied in the bootp response.
