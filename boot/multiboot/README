Description:
	This directory implements a MultiBoot->MultiBoot boot-adaptor.
	It allows the user to create another MultiBoot-compliant
	kernel from a MultiBoot-compliant kernel plus any arbitrary
	boot-modules.
	If no boot-modules are specified, then this directory basically
	implements the identity function.

	mkmbimage is a script for linking a MultiBoot kernel image and
	arbitrary boot-modules with mbboot.o to create an image
	loadable by a MultiBoot-compliant boot loader,
	such as GRUB or netboot.

	mbboot.o creates a multiboot_info struct from the information
	in its own multiboot_info struct,
	as well as information about any boot-modules the mkmbimage
	script may have added.
	It then passes this to the kernel it will boot.
