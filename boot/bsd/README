Description:  
	This directory implements a MultiBoot->BSD boot-adaptor.
	It allows the user to create a BSD-bootable image from a
	MultiBoot-compliant kernel plus any arbitrary boot-modules.

	mkbsdimage is a script for linking a kernel image
	and arbitrary boot-modules
	with bsdboot.o to create an image loadable by the 
	BSD boot loader.

	bsdboot.o is the icky magic needed to interface with
	the BSD boot loader.
	It takes the info given to it by the BSD boot loader (boothowto, etc),
	as well as the boot-module info added by mkbsdimage,
	and creates a multiboot_info struct to pass to the booted
	kernel.
