1.0 -> 1.1
	- uses fdev stuff now and thus supports many more NICs (built with
	  (vortex, tulip, hp-plus, and ne2000)
	- stores netmask in hostorder consistantly now  Used to always send
	  to the gateway, duh!
	- called netbooty now

1.1 -> 1.2
	- called netboot again
	- uses the OSKit bootp library
	- cleanup, flux->oskit, other renaming

1.2 -> 2.01
	- Got it to be a multiboot kernel, instead of a BSD one.
	  This simplifies the code and will enable us to work on Linux
	  in the future.

2.01 -> 2.02
	- Made it boot multiboot kernels now, not BSD ones.
	  This is mainly so we can pass them arbitrary command lines, which
	  will eventually include a "return address" so we can regain control
	  after the booted kernel exits.
	  A disadvantage is that thre isn't a multiboot-boot-adaptor yet, so
	  we can't glob a bunch of bmods together into a multiboot image like
	  we can for BSD images.
	- Various cleanup, bugfixes, and reorganization

2.02 -> 2.1
	- Implemented the regain-control feature.
	- Implemented simple hostname lookup.

2.1 -> 2.2
	- Fixed the bug with using kernels bigger than approx 16M.
	- Fixed the random memdebug "bad head magic" and LMM trashing,
	  I think (by getting mem_lock from libkern instead of libc).
	- Minor appearance tweaks.

2.2 -> 2.3
	- Fixed command-line parsing to not thing everything after
	  the last slash is the kernel name.  Therefore it now works to
	  have slashes in your command line like PATH=/bin:/usr/bin

2.3 -> 2.4
	- Fixed driver.c to use the new com_queue implementation of
	  oskit_queue_t instead of the `struct packet_queue' thing,
	  which was actually a stack(!).  This apparently fixes the
	  hangs after the "Root server: 155.99.123.45, dir:..." line
	  that were happening to Roland and me.  It also prevents
	  `net_receive' from doing any mallocing.
	- Removed bogus check that was preventing LILO from booting
	  netboot.  LILO wasn't passing any args.
	- Print oskit_error_t's as hex.
	- Various cleanup.

2.4 -> 2.5
	- Various updates to deal with new commandline format, which
	  is like:
		progname [<booting-options and foo=bar> --] <args to main>
	- As a result, we are now responsible for providing argv[0],
	  and use the `file' part of the ip:/dir/file pseudo-URL.

2.5 -> 2.5.1
	- Fixed to not call strlen(0).  This is bad.  More specifically,
	  if the program before us stored a bunch of poo at addr 0, then
	  we can blow our stack in build_cmdline, which allocates
	  a dynmaic stack array.

2.5.1 -> 2.6
	- Added NFS readahead code

2.6 -> 2.6.1
	- Added query for nfs readahead from environment

2.6.1 -> 2.6.2
	- Fixed ever-incrementing 'input' variable with leading spaces
	- Changed main to return int (eliminate compiler warning)
	Added fixes from Klaus Espenlaub <espenlaub@informatik.uni-ulm.de>:
	- Pass the multiboot magic number in register %eax.
	- Add code to properly number the IP packets sent out.
	- Pass in the buffer size to parse_cmdline (for future robustness)
	- When checking the multiboot image, replace panic()s with
	  a failure return so we can recover.
