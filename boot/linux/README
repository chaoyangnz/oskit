Description:  

This directory implements a MultiBoot->Linux boot-adaptor.
It allows the user to create a Linux-bootable image from a
MultiBoot-compliant kernel plus any arbitrary boot-modules.

mklinuximage is a script for linking a kernel image and arbitrary
boot-modules with linuxboot.bin to create an image loadable by LILO.

NOTE 1: the size of the linuxboot.bin code+data+bss cannot exceed 64K.
If it does, it will not work.  (To check the size, "make linuxboot"
and run "size".)  In general, you must build with the assert's compiled
out to get the size down, in this directory and in all libraries it uses
(at least exec kern c lmm).  This can be accomplished by configuring with
--disable-asserts and without --enable-debug.

NOTE 2: See the BUGS.details file: the most recent tool chain versions on
Linux fail to correctly build linuxboot.bin.  Therefore we've provided a
binary linuxboot.bin.good in the source distribution (though it hasn't
been well tested).  It's also available from our Web site if you clobber it.

NOTE 3: Another option for booting on Linux is GRUB, a powerful
multiboot-compliant boot loader that can boot off a floppy, available
from http://www.uruk.org/grub/ (a slow link), or from our OSKit ftp site,
ftp://ftp.flux.cs.utah.edu/flux/others/grub-0.5.tar.gz.

Some of the files in this directory are taken verbatim from the Linux
kernel source distribution.  These files are listed in the
Update-from-Linux shell script, and should be kept in sync with and
unmodified from the standard Linux distribution if at all possible.  If any
modifications are needed, maybe they could be integrated into the standard
Linux distribution instead of making the oskit versions diverge.  In any
case be sure to keep the Update-from-Linux script up-to-date.  

----
All of the Linux-derived files are covered by the GNU General Public
License, as is the rest of the code here.  Please see the file COPYING
for details on the GNU General Public License (GPL) and distribution
requirements.  As stipulated in the GPL, any code linked against this
source is also covered under GPL and must be distributed according to
its terms.  Therefore, any boot images built with the 'mklinuximage'
script will contain code from this directory, and therefore the ENTIRE
resulting boot image will fall under the GPL.
