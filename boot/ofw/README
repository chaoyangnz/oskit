Description:  
	This directory implements an OFW->Multiboot boot-adaptor.
	It allows the user to create an OFW-bootable image from a
	MultiBoot-compliant kernel plus any arbitrary boot-modules.

	mkofwimage is a script for linking a kernel image
	and arbitrary boot-modules
	with ofwboot.o to create an image loadable by the 
	OFW boot loader.

	ofwboot.o is the icky magic needed to interface with
	the OFW boot loader.
	It takes the info given to it by the OFW boot loader
	as well as the boot-module info added by mkbsdimage,
	and creates a multiboot_info struct to pass to the booted
	kernel.

	ldscript.elf2bsd is the linker script that tells the GNU linker
	how to take ELF binaries and produce an OFW compliant image
	(netbsd a.out format) using linker emulation.
