Description: 
	Bootstrap adaptors and standalone boot programs.

	The boot adaptors provide native boot loader format binaries
	for OSKit kernels which expect to be booted from a multiboot
	environment.  See the ``Booting Kernels'' section of the
	documentation for details.  The bsd, dos, linux, multiboot,
	and ofw directories contain boot adaptors.

	The remaining directories contain standalone bootstrap
	programs that are themselves OSKit kernels.  net is the
	netboot utility described in the ``Netboot'' section of
	the documentation.  The other two directories contain small,
	simple first-stage boot loaders intended to themselves be
	booted from OpenFirmware (ofwboot) or via the PXE protocol
	(pxe).  Once booted, both use the custom UDP-based bootinfo
	protocol (see oskit/boot/bootwhat.h) to communicate with a
	server (simple example in oskit/boot/pxe/bootinfo) to determine
	what kernel to boot.  See the individual README files for
	more details.
